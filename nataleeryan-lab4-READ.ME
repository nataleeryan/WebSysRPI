Lab 4 AJAX/JSON

I chose to leave a console.log statement to show that all of my JSON data is being retrieved. The way I coded, only the last object in the JSON file is displayed on HTML, which is what deemed acceptable from conversations with my group and their conversations with Satej. He stated if only one of many JSON objects was loaded, that was fine.

I did not add any styling as that wasn't stated as necessary in the lab. I also learned to format my JSON better.
